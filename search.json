It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or predictors). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia"

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website at sta210-s22.github.io/website.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Sakai, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly.

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions.

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

    "text": "Peer review\nCritically reviewing others’ work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception. Each lab team will be assigned another team’s project to review. Each team should push their draft to their GitHub repo by the due date. One lecture in the following week will be dedicated to the peer review, and all reviews will be due by the end of that week.\nDuring the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your partner team’s GitHub repo. Provide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team’s GitHub repo. The peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team’s report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions."

    "text": "Written report\nYour written report must be completed in the written-report.qmd file and must be reproducible. All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo = FALSE.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe following supplemental notes were created by Dr. Maria Tackett for STA 210. They are provided for students who want to dive deeper into the mathematics behind regression and reflect some of the material covered in STA 211: Mathematics of Regression. Additional supplemental notes will be added throughout the semester.\n\n\nThis document contains the mathematical details for deriving the least-squares estimates for slope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) and intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)).

    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\qquad(5)\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(6)\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\qquad(7)\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(8)\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(9)\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

Note that the covariance matrix is \\(E[(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T]\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T] &= E[(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T]\\\\\n& = E[(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}] \\\\\n& = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T E[\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^T]\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\\n& = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T (\\sigma^2\\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\\n&= \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\\n& = \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\\\\n&  = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(12)\\]"

If you’ve selected just a single file, it will only download that. The downloaded file will go to wherever files you download off the internet goes on your computer (usually your Downloads folder)."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

    "section": "Exercises",
    "text": "Exercises\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in-person voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is “Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?”\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Counties in North Carolina\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus on counties in North Carolina. We will use the data sets election_nc and county_map_data.\n\nVisualize the distribution of the response variable inperson_pct and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\nLet’s view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of North Carolina with the color of each county filled in based on the percentage of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election. Fill in title and axis labels.\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\nWhat are 2 - 3 observations you have from the plot?\nWhat is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn’t apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise? What is a feature that is apparent in the histogram that is not apparent in the map?\n\n\n\nelection_map_data <- left_join(election_nc, county_map_data)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = county_map_data,\n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n    fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"white\"\n    ) +\n  geom_polygon(data = election_map_data, \n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n    fill = inperson_pct)\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"___\",\n    y = \"___\",\n    fill = \"___\",\n    title = \"___\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  coord_quickmap()\n\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between inperson_pct and pctTrump_2016. Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, now is a good time to render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe can use a linear regression model to better quantify the relationship between the variables.\n\nFit the linear model to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nWrite the regression equation using mathematical notation.\n\nNow let’s use the model coefficients to describe the relationship.\n\nInterpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\nDoes it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\nIf the linear model is a good fit to these data, there should be no structure left in the residuals and the residuals should have constant variance. Augment the data with the model to obtain the residuals and predicted values for each observation, and call the augmented data frame nc_election_aug (You will use this name in Exercise 8). Then, make a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values, and based on this plot, and provide a brief explanation for whether these two conditions are met. Hint: Zoom out on the plot by extending the limits of the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven’t done so recently and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe might also be interested in our observations being independent, particularly if we are to use these data for inference. To evaluate whether the independence condition is met, we will examine a map of the counties in North Carolina with the color filled based on the value of the residuals.\n\nBriefly explain why we may want to view the residuals on a map to assess independence.\nBriefly explain what pattern (if any) we would expect to observe on the map if the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nFill in the name of your model in the code below to calculate the residuals and add them to election_map_data. Then, a map with the color of each county filled in based on the value of the residual. Hint: Start with the code from Exercise 2.\nIs the independence condition satisfied? Briefly explain based on what you observe from the plot.\n\nnc_election_aug <- nc_election_aug %>% \n  bind_cols(fips = election_nc$fips)\n\nelection_map_data <- left_join(election_map_data, nc_election_aug)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next part, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Inference for the U.S.\nTo get a better understanding of the trend across the entire United States, we analyze data from a random sample of 200 counties. This data is in the election_sample data frame. Because these counties were randomly selected out of the 3,006 counties in the United States, we can reasonably treat the counties as independent observations.\n\nFit the linear model to these sample data to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope using a permutation test. In your response, state the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and state the conclusion in the context of the data.\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\nComment on whether the hypothesis test and confidence interval support the general consensus that Republican voters were more likely to vote in-person in the 2020 election? A brief explanation is sufficient but it should be based on your conclusions from Exercises 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates."

Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they’re in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they’re not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\nHigh correlation, good or bad? Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nTraining for the 5K. Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: days_since_start (number of days since starting training), days_till_race (number of days left until the race), mood (poor, good, awesome), tiredness (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and time (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss).

For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIf predictors are colinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable’s coefficient.\nSuppose a numerical predictor \\(x\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2.5\\) in a multiple regression model. Suppose also that the first observation has \\(x_{1,1} = 7.2\\), the second observation has a value of \\(x_{2,1} = 8.2\\), and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\nIf a regression model’s first predictor has a coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 5.7\\) and if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its \\(x_1\\) be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value \\(\\hat{y}_1\\) for this observation would increase by 5.7."

Next we’ll be focusing on bill depth and bill length and also considering species.\n\nFit a model predicting bill depth from bill length. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nThen, add a new predictor: species. Fit another model predicting bill depth from bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nFinally, add one more predictor: the interaction between bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nUsing the three criteria you recorded for these three models, and with the goal of parsimony, which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species. Explain your reasoning.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part a. Hint: Make a scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length and add the linear model.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part b. Hint: Same as part (e), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part c. Hint: Same as part (f), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nBased on your visualizations from parts e - g, and with the goal of parsimony, is your answer for which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species the same as your answer in part d? Explain your reasoning."

For this study titled Influence of perceived threat of Covid-19 and HEXACO personality traits on toilet paper stockpiling, researchers conducted an online survey March 23 - 29, 2020 and used the results to fit multiple linear regression models to draw conclusions about their research questions. From their survey, they collected data on adults across 35 countries. Given the small number of responses from people outside of the United States, Canada, and Europe, only responses from people in these three locations were included in the regression analysis.\nLet’s consider their results for the model looking at the effect on perceived threat of Covid-19. The model can be found on page 6 of the paper. The perceived threat of Covid was quantified using the responses to the following survey question:\n\nHow threatened do you feel by Coronavirus? [Users select on a 10-point visual analogue scale (Not at all threatened to Extremely Threatened)]\n\n\nInterpret the coefficient of Age (0.072) in the context of the analysis.\nInterpret the coefficient of Place of residence in the context of the analysis.\nThe model includes an interaction between Place of residence and Emotionality (capturing differential tendencies in to worry and be anxious).\n\nWhat does the coefficient for the interaction (0.101) mean in the context of the data?\nInterpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in the US/Canada.\nInterpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in Europe."

After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nFinally, we want to answer the question “Do the data provide sufficient evidence of a linear relationship between cost and admissions rate, i.e. \\(\\beta_1\\) is different from 0?”\nTo answer this question we will use a hypothesis test. We can conduct a hypothesis test via simulation (what we’ll do in this lab) or using mathematical models (what we’ll do in the next class).\nBefore we can conduct the hypothesis test, let’s first set our hypotheses. Remember that the null hypothesis represents the status quo (nothing going on, i.e. there is no relationship) and the alternative hypothesis represents our research question (there is something going on, i.e. there is a relationship).\n\n\\(H_0\\): There is no linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)\n\\(H_A\\): There is a linear relationship between the admissions rate and cost of colleges in the United States, \\(\\beta_1 \\ne 0\\)\n\nTo test these hypotheses, we will use a permutation test, where we\n\nSimulate new samples from the original sample via permutation under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true\nFit models to each of the samples and estimate the slope\nUse features of the distribution of the permuted slopes to calculate the p-value for the hypothesis test\n\nThe major difference between constructing a confidence interval and conducting a hypothesis test is that for the hypothesis test we assume that the null hypothesis is true. This requires a simulation scheme that will allow us to measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but not due to cost and admission rate being correlated by permuting permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables. To do so, we randomly assign each admrate value to cost of a given university, i.e. cost and admrate are no longer matched for a given university.\nIn the following code chunk we\n\nFirst set a seed for simulating reproducibly.\nThen, we start with our data frame and specify our model as cost vs. admrate.\nThen, we set our null hypothesis (cost and admrate are independent)\nAnd then we generate 1000 replicates of our data where, for each replicate, we permute values of admrate to randomly assign them to values of cost\nFinally, we fit our model to each of our 1000 permuted datasets\n\n\nset.seed(1234)\n\nperm_fits <- scorecard %>%\n  specify(cost ~ admrate) %>%\n  hypothesize(null = \"independence\") %>%\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"permute\") %>%\n  fit()\n\nThe resulting dataset perm_fits has nrow(perm_fits) and ncol(perm_fits) columns. The first column, replicate indicates the replicate number of the dataset the models were fit to; the values in this column range between 1 and 1000. The second column, term, tells us which term (intercept of the model or slope of admrate) the estimate value in the third column is for.\n\nperm_fits\n\n# A tibble: 2,000 × 3\n# Groups:   replicate [1,000]\n   replicate term      estimate\n       <int> <chr>        <dbl>\n 1         1 intercept  36857. \n 2         1 admrate     -781. \n 3         2 intercept  35901. \n 4         2 admrate      643. \n 5         3 intercept  36608. \n 6         3 admrate     -411. \n 7         4 intercept  35831. \n 8         4 admrate      746. \n 9         5 intercept  36367. \n10         5 admrate      -51.7\n# … with 1,990 more rows\n\n\n\nCreate a histogram of the slope estimates in perm_fits. (Hint: Filter the dataset for just the slope values, term == \"admrate\".)\nEstimate the p-value of the hypothesis test based on this distribution.\nState your conclusion for the test in context.\nIndicate whether or not it is consistent with the results of the hypothesis test from the previous exercise. Briefly explain your response.\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.

    "section": "Exercises",
    "text": "Exercises\n\nData prep\n\nExercise 1\nIdentify episodes that touch on Halloween, Valentine’s Day, and Christmas.\n\nFirst, convert all text to lowercase with str_to_lower().\nThen, create three new variables (halloween_mention, valentine_mention, and christmas_mention) where that take on the value 1 if the character string \"halloween\", \"valentine\", or \"christmas\" appears in the text, respectively, and 0 otherwise.\n\nSome code is provided below to help you get started.\n\ntheoffice <- theoffice %>%\n  mutate(\n    text = ___(text),\n    halloween_mention = if_else(str_detect(text, \"___\"), ___, ___),\n    valentine_mention = ___,\n    ___ = ___\n  )\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nIn this exercise we’ll accomplish two separate tasks. And there’s a good reason why we’re doing it all at once; we’re going to drastically change our data frame, from one row per line spoken to one row per episode. We’ll call the resulting data frame office_episodes.\nThe two tasks are as follows:\n\nTask 1. Identify episodes where the word “halloween”, “valentine”, or “christmas” were ever mentioned, using variables you created above.\nTask 2. Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of The Office.\n\nBelow are some instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\nStart by grouping theoffice data by season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, and air_date. (These variables, except for season have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\nUse summarize() to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\nTask 1:\n\nCalculate the number of lines per season per episode, you might name this new variable n_lines.\nThen, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four characters Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, and lines_dwight, respectively.\n\nTask 2:\n\nCreate a variable called halloween that sums up the 1s in halloween_mention at the season-episode level and takes on the value \"yes\" if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or \"no\" otherwise.\nDo something similar for new variables valentine and christmas as well based on values from valentine_mention and christmas_mention.\n\nFinish up your summarize() statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped and remove n_lines (we won’t use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n\noffice_episodes <- theoffice %>%\n  group_by(___) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) >= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  select(-n_lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhy summarize() and not mutate()? We use mutate() to add / modify a column of a data frame. The output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame. On the other hand, we use summarize() to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\nAnd what about that .groups argument in summarize? Try running your summarize() step without it first. You’ll see that R print out a message saying “summarize() has grouped output by season, episode. You can override using the .groups argument.” summarize() will only drop the last group. So if you want a data frame that doesn’t have a grouping structure as a result of a summaerize(), you can explicitly ask for that with .groups = \"drop\". Before you proceed, read the documentation for summarize(), and specifically the explanation for the .groups argument to prepare yourself for future instances where you might see this type of message.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nThe Michael Scott character (played by Steve Carrell) left the show at the end of Season 7. Add an indicator variable, michael, that takes on the value \"yes\" if Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) was in the show, and \"no\" if not.\n\noffice_episodes <- office_episodes %>%\n  mutate(michael = if_else(season > ___, \"___\", \"___\"))\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nPrint out the dimensions (dim()) of the new dataset you created as well as the names() of the columns in the dataset.\nYour new dataset, office_episodes, should have 186 rows and 14 columns. The column names should be season, episode, episode_name, imdb_rating, total_votes, air_date, lines_jim, lines_pam, lines_michael, lines_dwight, halloween, valentine, christmas, and michael. If you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong. Or ask your TA for help!\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message, and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\nIt’s also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard! A team member who hasn’t done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\nThis would be a good place to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA). For example, plot the proportion of lines spoken by each character over time. Or calculate the percentage of episodes that mention Halloween, or Valentine’s Day, or Christmas. Given we have limited time in the lab we’re not going to ask you to report EDA results as part of this lab, but we’re noting this here to provide suggestions for how you might go about structuring your project.\n\n\nModeling prep\n\nExercise 5\nSplit the data into training (75%) and testing (25%). Save the training and testing data as office_train and office_test respectively.\nNaming suggestion: Call the initial split office_split, the training data office_train, and testing data office_test.\n\nset.seed(123)\noffice_split <- ___(office_episodes)\noffice_train <- ___(office_split)\noffice_test <- ___(___)\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nSpecify a linear regression model with engine \"lm\" and call it office_spec.\nNaming suggestion: Call the model specification office_spec.\n\noffice_spec <- ___\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nCreate a recipe that performs feature engineering using the following steps (in the given order):\n\nupdate_role(): updates the role of episode_name to not be a predictor (be an ID)\nstep_rm(): removes air_date as a predictor\nstep_dummy(): creates dummy variables for all_nominal_predictors()\nstep_zv(): removes all zero variance predictors\n\nNaming suggestion: Call the recipe office_rec.\n\noffice_rec <- recipe(imdb_rating ~ ., data = office_train) %>%\n  ___\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message, and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\nIt’s also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard! A team member who hasn’t done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n\n\n\nExercise 8\nBuild a model workflow for fitting the model specified earlier and using the recipe you developed to preprocess the data.\nNaming suggestion: Call the model workflow office_wflow.\n\noffice_wflow <- workflow() %>%\n  add_model(___) %>%\n  add_recipe(___)\n\n\n\n\nModel fit and evaluation\n\nExercise 9\nFit the model to training data, neatly display the model output, and interpret two of the slope coefficients.\nNaming suggestion: Call the model fit office_fit.\n\noffice_fit <- office_wflow %>%\n  fit(data = ___)\n\n___\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nCalculate predicted imdb_rating for the training data using the predict() function. Then, bind two columns from the training data to this result: imdb_rating and episode_name. The resulting data frame should have three columns: .pred, imdb_rating, and episode_name. Then, using this data frame, create a scatterplot of predicted and observed IMDB ratings for the training data.\nNaming suggestion: Call the resulting data frame office_train_pred.\nStretch goal. Add episode names, using geom_text(), for episodes with much higher and much lower observed IMDB ratings compared to others.\n\n\nExercise 11\nCalculate the R-squared and RMSE for this model for predictions on the training data.\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message, and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\nIt’s also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard! A team member who hasn’t done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n\n\n\nExercise 12\nRepeat Exercise 10, but with testing data.\nNaming suggestion: Call the resulting data frame office_test_pred.\n\n\nExercise 13\nBased on your visualization on Exercise 12, speculate on whether you expect the R-squared and RMSE for this model to be higher or lower for predictions on the testing data compared to those on the training data, or do you expect them to be the same? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\nExercise 14\nCheck your intuition in Exercise 13 by actually calculating the R-squared and RMSE for this model for predictions on the training data. Comment on whether your intuition is confirmed or not."

An observation s set if have high leverage if its combination of values for the predictor variables is very far from the typical combination of values in the data.An observation has high leverage if its combination of values for the predictor variables is very far from the typical combination of values in the data. Observations with high leverage should be considered as potential influential points.\nWe will proceed assuming the model conditions hold, so let’s focus on the model diagnostics. We’ll start by examining if there are any points with high leverage in the data.\nTheoretically, the leverage of the \\(i^{th}\\) observation as follows:\n\\[\nh_i = \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j = 1}^n (x_j - \\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nNote that leverage only depends on values of the predictor variable(s).\nThe sum of the leverages for all points is \\(p + 1\\), where\n\n\\(p\\) is the number of predictors\nIn the case of SLR, \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^n h_i = 2\\)\nThe “typical” leverage is \\(\\frac{(p + 1)}{n}\\)\n\nTherefore, an observation is said to have high leverage if\n\\[\nh_i > \\frac{2(p + 1)}{n}\n\\]\nIn addition to comparing the leverage of points to a threshold, we also generally visualize standard residuals vs. leverage values our data. The autoplot() function from the ggfortify package is very useful for drawing these standard plots easily.\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 5)\n\n\nWhat threshold will you use to determine if there are points with high leverage for this dataset?\nAre there any observations with high leverage? If so, how many? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response. Improve your plot by adding a new year to draw a vertical line (with geom_vline()) at the value of the threshold you’re using to determine which points have high leverage.\n\n\nTeam Member 2: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 3, 4: Once Team Member 2 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo. Then, in RStudio, click the Pull button in the Git pane to get the updated document. You should see the responses to Exercises 3 and 4 in your .qmd file.\n\n\nNow it’s time for another hand off…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Team Member 3: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 5.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nAnother standard model diagnostic involves identifying points that don’t fit the pattern from the regression line. We do this by determining which points have large standardized residuals (residual divided by the standard error of residuals).\n\\[\nStd.~res_i = \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_1}{\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon ~ \\sqrt{1 - h_i}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon\\) is the regression standard error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThese values are already calculated in the output of augment().\n\n\nObservations that have standardized residuals of large magnitude (usually beyond \\(\\pm\\) 3) are potential outliers, since they don’t fit the pattern determined by the regression model. Therefore, a common practice is to plot standardized residuals vs. fitted values, to make it easier to identify outliers.\nWe can obtain this plot with the following:\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 3)\n\nCreate this visualization and horizontal lines (with geom_hline()) at the cutoff values for “large” standardized residuals (\\(\\pm\\) 3). Are there any such points in the data? If so, how many? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\n\nTeam Member 3: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 2, 4: Once Team Member 3 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo. Then, in RStudio, click the Pull button in the Git pane to get the updated document. You should see the responses to Exercise 5 and 4 in your .qmd file.\n\n\nNow it’s time for another hand off…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⌨️ Team Member 4: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 6.\n🙅🏽 All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nFinally, we’ll examine Cook’s Distance. An observation’s influence on the regression line depends on how close it lies to the general trend of the data (i.e., its standardized residual) and it’s leverage (\\(h_i\\)). Cook’s Distance is a statistic that includes both of these components to measure an observation’s overall impact on the model. Cook’s Distance for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation is defined as the follows:\n\\[\nD_i = \\frac{(std.~res)^2}{p + 1} (\\frac{h_i}{1-\\frac{h_i})\n\\]\nAn observation with large \\(D_i\\) is said to have a strong influence on the predicted values. On that scale,\n\n\\(D_i\\) > 0.5 is moderately influential\n\\(D_i\\) > 1 is very influential\n\nWe can plot of Cook’s distances vs. the observation number with the following:\n\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 4, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\nStandardized residuals, leverage, and Cook’s Distance should all be examined together. So what do we do with observations identified as outliers or leverage points?\nIt is OK to drop an observation based on the predictor variables if…\n\nIt is meaningful to drop the observation given the context of the problem\nYou intended to build a model on a smaller range of the predictor variables. You should mention this in the write up of the results and be careful to avoid extrapolation when making predictions.\n\nIt is not OK to drop an observation based on the response variable if…\n\nThese are legitimate observations and should be in the model.\nYou can try transformations or increasing the sample size by collecting more data.\n\nSo lastly, let’s analyze Cook’s D to determine if there are influential points in the data.\n\nBased on Cook’s D, are there any influential points in our data? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\nIf there are influential points, briefly explain why they are outliers, i.e., not in the trend of the rest of the data.\nIf there are influential points, remove those points from the data and refit the model. How do the model coefficients change, if at all?\nIf there are influential points, would you recommend using the model fit with or without these points for inferential conclusions and predictions? Briefly explain why or why not. Additionally, briefly explain potential impacts your choice has on inferential conclusions and/or predictions.\n\n\nTeam Member 4: Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the .qmd and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n\n\nTeam Members 1, 2, 3: Once Team Member 4 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team’s lab repo.

The main goal is to reinforce our understanding of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce git and GitHub, the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nGit is a version control system (like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\n\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nTo make versioning simpler, this is a solo lab. In the future, you’ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and producing a single lab report for your lab team, but for now, concentrate on getting the basics down.\n\nLearning goals\nBy the end of the lab, you will…\n\nBe familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using RMarkdown\nPractice version control using GitHub\nBe able to create data visualizations using ggplot2\nBe able to describe variable distributions and the relationship between multiple variables"

You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used, e.g., sta210).\n\nYou can find more detailed instructions here if you’re interested.\n\n\nConfigure Git\nThere is one more thing we need to do before getting started on the assignment. Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nTo do so, you will use the use_git_config() function from the usethis package.\nType the following lines of code in the console in RStudio filling in your name and the email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"GitHub username\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\n  )\n\nFor example, mine would be\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"mine-cetinkaya-rundel\", \n  user.email = \"cetinkaya.mine@gmail.com\"\n  )\n\nYou are now ready interact with GitHub via RStudio!\n\n\nClone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\nGo to the course organization at github.com/sta210-s22 organization on GitHub.

This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n\n\nR and R Studio\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\nYAML\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOpen the Quarto (`.qmd`) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. click on Push."

Throughout the assignment, you should periodically Render your Quarto document to produce the updated PDF, commit the changes in the Git pane, and push the updated files to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMake sure we can read all or your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (%>%) and plus sign (+).\n\n\n\nExercise 1\nThe view() function helped us get a quick view of the dataset, but let’s get more detail about its structure. Viewing a summary of the data is a useful starting point for data analysis, especially if the dataset has a large number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Run the code below to use the glimpse() function to see a summary of the ikea dataset.\nHow many observations are in the ikea dataset? How many variables?\n\nglimpse(ikea)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn your lab-1-ikea.qmd document you’ll see that we already added the code required for the exercise as well as a sentence where you can fill in the blanks to report the answer. Use this format for the remaining exercises.\nAlso note that the code chunk as a label: glimpse-data. It’s not required, but good practice and highly encouraged to label your code chunks in this way.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nWe begin each regression analysis with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help us “get to know” the data and examine the variable distributions and relationships between variables. We do this by visualizing the data and calculating summary statistics to describe the variables in our dataset. In this lab, we will focus on data visualizations.\nLet’s begin by looking at the price of Ikea furniture. Use the code below to visualize the distribution of price_usd, the price in US dollars.\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the visualization to describe the distribution of price. In your narrative, include description of the shape, approximate center, approximate spread, and any presence of outliers. Briefly explain why the median is more representative of the center of this distribution than the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen using the visual editor you can insert a code chunk using the Insert menu on top or by using the catch-all ⌘ / shortcut to insert just about anything. Just execute the shortcut then type what you want to insert. If you are at the beginning of a line you can also enter plain / to invoke the shortcut.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWhen we make visualizations, we want them to be clear and suitable for a professional audience. This means that, at a minimum, each visualization should have an informative title and informative axis labels. Let’s modify the plot from the previous question to make it suitable for a professional audience. Complete the code below to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"_____\",\n    y = \"_____\",\n    title = \"_____\"\n  )\n\n\nThis is a good place to fender, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nAnother way to visualize numeric data is using density plots. Make a density plot to visualize the distribution of price_usd. Be sure to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\nIn this course, we’ll be most interested in the relationship between two or more variables, so let’s begin by looking at the distribution of price by category. We’ll focus on the five categories in the code below, since these include commonly purchased types of furniture.\nUse the code below to create a new data frame that only includes the furniture categories of interest. We’re assigning this data frame to an object with a new name, so we don’t overwrite the original data.\nHow many observations are in the ikea_sub dataset? How many variables?\n\nikea_sub <- ikea %>%\n  filter(category %in% c(\n    \"Tables & desks\", \"Beds\",\n    \"Bookcases & shelving units\",\n    \"Sofas & armchairs\", \"Children's furniture\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou will use this newly constructed data frame, ikea_sub, for the remainder of the lab.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nLet’s make a new visualization with the density curves colored by category, so we can compare the distribution of price for each category.\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nThe overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what’s happening with the distributions for the categories plotted first and hence covered by categories plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The alpha argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so it’s best to try a few.\nRecreate the density plot using a more suitable alpha level, so we can more easily see the distribution of all the categories. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 4 and 5”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nBriefly describe why we defined the fill of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot (inside the aes function) but we defined the alpha level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.\n\n\nExercise 7\nOverlapping density plots are not the only way to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable.\nUse a different type of plot to visualize the relationship between price_usd and category. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use the ggplot2 cheatsheet and from Data to Viz for inspiration.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\nCompare and contrast your plots from the previous exercise to the overlapping density plots from Exercise 5. What features are apparent in the plot from the previous exercise that aren’t in the overlapping density plots? What features are apparent in the overlapping density plots that aren’t in the plot from the previous exercise? What features are apparent in both?\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo on GitHub. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 6 - 8”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nNext, let’s look at the relationship between the price and width of Ikea furniture. Fill in the code below to visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatterplot.\nThen, use your visualization to describe the relationship between the width and price of Ikea furniture.\n\nggplot(data = _____, aes(x = width, y = _____)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"_____\", \n    y = \"_____\", \n    title = \"_____\"\n    )\n\n\n\nExercise 10\nColor the points of the scatterplot by category. Describe how the relationship between price and width of Ikea furniture differs by category, if at all.\n\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! Render, commit, and push all remaining changes. You can use the commit message “Done with Lab 1!” , and make sure you have committed and pushed all changed files to GitHub (your Git pane in RStudio should be empty) and that all documents are updated in your repo on GitHub. The PDF document you submit to Gradescope should be identical to the one in your GitHub repo."
