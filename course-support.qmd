Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

## Lectures and labs

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!
There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course.
You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments.
A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource.
I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource!
Make a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class.
If you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself.

## Discussion forum

Have a question that can't wait for office hours?
Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person?
The online discussion forum is the best venue for these!
We will use [Conversations](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/site/779c3ebe-3b88-4bcc-bd01-1813e8396a23/tool/13b6446a-a6c6-4222-8cfb-c36d1f70802b) as the online discussion forum.
There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed Discussion before adding a new question.
If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!

## Email

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go [Conversations](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/site/779c3ebe-3b88-4bcc-bd01-1813e8396a23/tool/13b6446a-a6c6-4222-8cfb-c36d1f70802b)), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.).
For such matters, you may email Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel at [mc301\@duke.edu](mailto:mc301@duke.edu).

If there is a question that's not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly.
**If you email me, please include "STA 210" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday.
Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team.
In those instances, I encourage you to visit the **Academic Resource Center**.
The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.
Services include Learning Consultations, Peer Tutoring and Study Groups, ADHD/LD Coaching, Outreach Workshops, and more.
Because learning is a process unique to every individual, they work with each student to discover and develop their own academic strategy for success at Duke.
ARC services are available free to any Duke undergraduate student, in any year, studying in any discipline.
Contact the ARC to schedule an appointment.
Undergraduates in any year, studying any discipline can benefit!
Contact [theARC\@duke.edu](mailto:theARC@duke.edu), 919-684-5917.

## Five tips for success

Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it.
The
course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you.
Your TAs and I will
help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but
for this to work you must do the following:

1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.
2.  Ask questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs,
    ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than
    anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you're not
    sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds
    related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.
3.  Do the readings.
4.  Do the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It's not enough to just
    mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these
    exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to
    make questions for an exam, for example.)
5.  Don't procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will
    become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won't know
    where to begin asking questions. Don't let the week end with unanswered
    questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.
