title: "Course support"
---

We expect everyone will have questions at some point in the semester, so we encourage you to:

-   Ask questions during lectures and lab
-   Ask and answer questions on Conversations
-   Attend office hours
-   Reach out by email
-   Consult textbooks
-   Make use of resources for academic support
-   Make use of resources for mental health and wellness

Read below to find out more about how to best make use of each of these resources.

## Lectures and lab

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!
There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Conversations

Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Conversations](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/site/779c3ebe-3b88-4bcc-bd01-1813e8396a23/tool/13b6446a-a6c6-4222-8cfb-c36d1f70802b).
There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed Discussion before adding a new question.
If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course.
You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments.
A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource.
Please use them!

You can find the schedule for office hours and associated links for online office hours in Sakai.

## Email

If you have questions about personal matters that are not appropriate for the public forum on Conversations (e.g. illness, accommodations, etc.), you may email Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel at [mc301\@duke.edu](mailto:mc301@duke.edu).
